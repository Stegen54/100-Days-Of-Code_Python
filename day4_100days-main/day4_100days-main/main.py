# The story text with color codes
story = f"""
In a {YELLOW}quiet village{RESET} nestled between towering mountains and dense forests, 
there lived a boy named {BOLD}Onyeali{RESET}. His heart raced at the thought of adventure, 
and his eyes sparkled whenever he heard tales of {GREEN}hidden treasures{RESET} and {CYAN}mystical places{RESET}.

One {YELLOW}bright morning{RESET}, as the sun cast a {YELLOW}golden glow{RESET} over the land, Onyeali decided 
to explore the {GREEN}Forgotten Forest{RESET}. His friends warned him, "{RED}Be careful, Onyeali!{RESET} 
They say the forest is full of mysteries!" But Onyeali just grinned and said, 
"{CYAN}That's what makes it so exciting!{RESET}" 

As he stepped into the {CYAN}shadows of the trees{RESET}, he felt a chill run down his spine. 
The {BLUE}air{RESET} was thick, and he could hear the distant {RED}howl{RESET} of animals echoing 
through the trees. But {BOLD}Onyeali{RESET} wasn't afraid. He pressed on, {YELLOW}fearlessly{RESET}, 
stepping over {GREEN}twisted roots{RESET} and pushing aside thick vines. 
{RED}Suddenly{RESET}, he spotted a {BLUE}glimmering stone{RESET} peeking out from under a rock. 
It was the {BOLD}{YELLOW}Legendary Sapphire of Power!{RESET}

His eyes widened as he carefully lifted the stone, feeling a {CYAN}pulse of energy{RESET} course 
through him. {BOLD}Onyeali{RESET} knew he had found something special, something powerful. 
With a wide grin, he held it up to the light, and the forest around him seemed to come alive 
with whispers and secrets.

"{YELLOW}The world has so many hidden wonders,{RESET}" Onyeali thought. He knew this was just 
the beginning of many {GREEN}adventures{RESET}. He couldn't wait to find out what lay beyond 
the next {BLUE}hill{RESET} and across the next {CYAN}river{RESET}.
